## ⚡ Overview

K-Storm is a **fully local** research topic brainstorming MVP. Multiple AI agents (Novelty, Mechanism, Feasibility, Reviewer) hold a structured, multi-round discussion on your research question, then produce a ready-to-use Markdown report for thesis proposals or group meetings.

**Zero cloud dependency** — works out of the box with the built-in mock provider. Plug in any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic API to unlock real agent reasoning.

## 🪄 Discussion Modes (v1.8)

| Mode | Agents | Rounds | Best For |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Full Deliberation** | 4 + Moderator | 1–5 | Comprehensive brainstorming → full IR + report |
| **Focused Panel** | Select 2–3 | 1–2 | Targeted deep-dive on specific questions |
| **Quick Probe** | 1 | 1 | Fast sanity check on one question |
| **Memory Query** | Select agents | 1–5 | Continue from a historical run's context |

## 🧭 Research Stages (v1.8)

K-Storm automatically detects which phase of the research cycle you're in based on the information density in your template, and adjusts the output focus accordingly. You can also override the detection manually.

| Stage | When | What Changes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Topic Exploration** | Sparse input, no clear topic yet | Agents propose candidate topics and direction suggestions |
| **Plan Refinement** | Well-defined topic + experiment design | Agents focus on pushing your current plan forward, not re-recommending new topics |
| **Result Diagnosis** | Input contains experimental data or results | Agents interpret results, locate bottlenecks, and design follow-up experiments |
| **Pivot Evaluation** | Input signals frustration, dead ends, or need to change direction | Agents evaluate whether to adjust the current line or pivot to an alternative |

<details>
<summary><b>How it works</b></summary>

The inference engine examines your template fields for:

1. **Result signals** — numerical data, fold-changes, sample sizes, p-values → `Result Diagnosis`
2. **Design maturity** — mentions of controls, replicates, specific assays, animal models → `Result Diagnosis` if dense enough
3. **Pivot signals** — keywords like "stuck", "bottleneck", "failed", "pivot", "switch direction" → `Pivot Evaluation`
4. **Plan maturity** — rich platform/constraints/target output + detailed existing basis (> 80 chars) → `Plan Refinement`
5. **Default** — everything else → `Topic Exploration`

The detected stage is injected into every agent prompt as a **stage label** + **stage goal**, and shapes the final report structure:
- Topic Exploration → "Recommended Topics Top 3-5" section
- Other stages → report body organized around advancing/diagnosing/adjusting the current line, with optional pivot suggestions at the end

</details>

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- 📋 **Structured template input** — research field, background, existing basis, constraints, goals
- 📎 **Document upload** with type tagging and per-document notes
- 🧩 **Hybrid large-document intake** — small uploads go through full-text intake; large uploads trigger per-document summary extraction + budgeted intake synthesis
- 🤖 **4 discussion agents** — Novelty · Mechanism · Feasibility · Reviewer
- 🎯 **Moderator** summarizes conflicts, omissions, and next-round questions
- 📊 **Structured IR** — candidate directions, evidence chains, critique points
- 📝 **Final Markdown report** — thesis-ready, with per-section copy buttons
- 📚 **External references** — agents cite papers/blogs/datasets; two-tier extraction; dedicated references page
- 🔄 **Run management** — stop, resume from failure, rerun from scratch
- 🗂️ **History** — search, filter, open past runs, delete
- 📤 **Export** — MD/PDF, JSON bundle, references export
- ✅ **Validated generation** — explicit end markers + structural checks prevent half-finished agent messages from advancing the workflow
- ⚙️ **Per-agent model assignment** — mix mock + OpenAI + Anthropic per agent slot
- 🏷️ **Discussion naming** — optionally name each run for easy identification in history
- ⚡ **Recommended config** — one-click model assignment based on agent role and available models
- 📝 **Markdown briefing** — agent briefing blocks render inline Markdown formatting

## 🏗️ Architecture

K-Storm is organized as a local research orchestration system: the React console handles input, debate visualization, reports, and history; the FastAPI backend runs the state machine and routes each agent slot to its assigned model. The deliberation group consists of four complementary roles:

- **Novelty Agent** — proposes new directions and differentiating angles
- **Mechanism Agent** — examines causal chains and mechanism plausibility
- **Feasibility Agent** — evaluates experiment design, resources, and execution cost
- **Reviewer Agent** — simulates peer-review criticism and exposes weak points

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **Node.js** 18+ (for the Vite frontend)

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Default uses **mock provider** — no API key needed.

### 2. Frontend (recommended)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> for the full v1.8 experience.

> The backend also serves a standalone UI at <http://localhost:8000> (legacy, no v1.8 features).

### 3. Configure Models (optional)

Browser-based model settings support:

| Provider Type | Examples |
|:--|:--|
| OpenAI Compatible | DeepSeek, DashScope, OpenRouter, Ollama, SiliconFlow |
| OpenAI Responses | OpenAI |
| Anthropic Messages | Claude |
| Coding Plan | Kimi, 百炼, 火山引擎 |

API keys stay in your browser's `localStorage` — never written to disk or SQLite.

<details>
<summary><b>Environment Variables (alternative)</b></summary>

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
KS_MODEL_PROVIDER=mock        # default, no key needed
# KS_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
```

</details>
